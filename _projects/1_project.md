6G-life is a BMBF-funded research hub, which will drive cutting-edge research for 6G communication networks with a focus on human-machine collaboration. 6G-life provides new approaches for sustainability, security, resilience and latency and will sustainably strengthen the economy and thus digital sovereignty in Germany.

## Motivation

TU Dresden and the Technical University of Munich have joined forces to form the 6G-life research hub to drive cutting-edge research for future 6G communication networks with a focus on human-machine collaboration. The merger of the two universities of excellence combines their world-leading preliminary work in the field of Tactile Internet in the Cluster of Excellence CeTI, 5G communication networks, quantum communication, Post-Shannon theory, artificial intelligence methods, and adaptive and flexible hardware and software platforms.

6G-life will significantly stimulate industry and the startup landscape in Germany through positive showcase projects and thus sustainably strengthen digital sovereignty in Germany. Test fields for two use cases will drive research and economic stimulation. The goal is to create at least 10 new startups through 6G-life in the first four years and to involve at least 30 startups. 6G-life will significantly contribute to the creation of a skilled workforce. In addition, 6G-life has set itself the task of accompanying the population in the digital transformation and thus making a contribution to society.

## Research Focus

Robotic assistance is growing interests for rehabilitation as well as for supporting movements of people with restricted mobility. In such scenarios, control adaptation to each and every user will make a significant contribution to the efficacy of the training and acceptance by the user. These controls require demanding real-time guarantees due to the direct physical human-machine interaction, and the access to personalized models of the user (human digital twin). Currently, the use of such systems is only possible to a limited extent in the laboratory environment due to the limitations in sensor communications and data processing capacities. Thus, the integration of 6G in-network computing promises a significant extension of the autonomy and mobility of personalised robotic assistance systems. The aim of R&D is to develop novel concepts and methods for controls for safety-critical systems through network computing.
